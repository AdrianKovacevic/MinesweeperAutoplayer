MinesweeperAutoplayer
=====================
A program that plays the Windows 7 version of Minesweeper automatically, at any difficulty. Press CTRL + ALT + D in order to stop 
the program once it starts. If you have the Windows 7 version of Minesweeper on a Windows 8 computer, it will still work. 

This program might not work on all computers, but it worked on all tested Windows 7 computers and on varying resolutions. All 
tested Windows 8 computers worked as well, but it was necessary for any display scaling to be at the default setting
and for a logout/login to be performed if the scaling settings were changed.
